Difference between prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells	-DNA packaged in Chromosomes and stored in nucleus --Have other membrane bound organells such as mitochondria and chloroplasts
What is a secretory pathway and what are the components of it?	-a series of organelles that directs newly made proteins to their proper destinations. --endoplasmic reticulum(ER) and the Golgi Apparatus
The mechanism employed by mitochondria and chloroplasts to generate ATP?	chemiosomosis
Difference between cellulose and chitin?	-cellulose are made of glucose while chitin is made of NAG --chitin has a 'N' in the chemical formula of the cell wall
List 4 major structural categories in Eukaryote cyto skeletons	-microtubules --microfilaments --intermediate filamments
How is the phylogeny of eukaryotic microbes determined	-through comparing SSU rRNA genes and other highly conserved genetic sequences.
What are the four traditional eukaryotic microbes?	-Fungi --Protozoa --Slime moulds --Algae
Saccharomyces cerevisiae likely have what features [2]	-It is a fungi (yeast), so it is likely to have a chitin cell wall and is heterotrophic
What is a plasmodium?	a large, multinucleated aggregate formed by slime moulds
slime moulds are __trophic	heterotrophic
What is a Dictyostelium discoideum	-a type of slime mould that can form fruiting bodies
Algae are __trophic	-photo
What is a Chlamydomas?	______
What is a haploid and what is a diploid?	-Diploid reproduce sexually by meiosis and contains two sets of chromosomes --haploid reporduce asexually by mitosis and contains one set of chromosomes
What type of Eukaryote cause malaria?	-Plasmodium falciparum, which is a type of protoza
What is a lysosome and what are its functions?	-an eukaryote organell that contain digestive enzymes which breaks down macromolecues
What is a peroxisome and what are its functions?	-breakdown fatty acids --contains various oxidative enzymes, such as catalase and oxidase
What is a hydrogenosome?	-production of H2 and ATP	-found in some amitochondriates --may be remnant of mitochondrion
list 3 double membrance structures found typically in eukayotes.	-Mitochondria --Chloroplasts --nucleus
What is transcription and where does it take place?	-transcription is the process of reading a piece of DNA and produce a mRNA --it takes place in the nucleus
What is translation and where doe it take place?	-Tanslation is the when mRNA is read by a ribosome and built into protein(Polypeptide chain)
What is the difference between rough and smooth ER?	-Rough ER has ribosomes attached. Proteins are modified in these
What is a mitochondria	Plays a role in cell metabolism --use electron transport chains to produce ATP --participates in later stages of cellular respiration
The lipid structure of eukaryote cell membrane is held together by	ester linkage
What are sterols for? Do you find them in bacteria and archaeons?	-they are for membrane stability --only found in eukaryotes, but some bacteria has stero like structures.
T or F eukarytoes has a higher abundance of protein in their cell membrance compared to bacteria and archeons	False. Think about it this way, prokaryotes has no cell organells so membranes has a lot more features to it
list 3 functions of the microtubules 	-Intracellular transport -- separation of chromosomes in mitosis and meiosis --cell movement (e.g. cilia and flagella)
list 3 functions of the microfilaments	-maintain cell shape --cell movment (pseudopods) --create division furrow in cytokinesis (?)
list 2 functions of Intermediate filaments	-Nuclear structure --cell-cell interactions
spindle fibers	assists in cell division
what is a axoneme	-9+2 array of microtubules that form a eukaryote flagella
What is the difference in motion of flagella between bacteria and eukarytoic cells?	-bacteria flagella move like a screw motion and is powered by proton motive force --eukaryotes flagella move in a whip like motion (powered by dynein) and get energy from hydrolysis of ATP
eukaryotes membrane is covered by	a cell membrane
How does eukaryote cytoskeleton faciliate intracellular transport?	-Kinesin walks along a microtubule carry a vesicle --can be exploited by pathogens that pretend to be a package
Why is Chlamydomonas a good example to study?	-is a algae with two flagella form good for studying eukaryal flagella biogenesis --is durable and easy to grow
Meiosis is _ haploid cells forming _ original diploid cell
an ascus is 	-a yeast haploid
Describe an algae reproductive life cycle	-haploid cell >> gametes >> spore >> meiosis to haploids 
Describe the life cycle of a Dictyostelium [5]	-a slime mould --exists as a haploid unicell --multicellular "slug" is formed whith a stalk and fruiting body --spores form in the fruiting body, restarting life cycle as haploid cells --hapliod cells can fuse into a diploid macrocyst form (a giant orgy spore) --macrocyst from undergoes meiosis to generate more haploid cells
Decribe the endosymbiotic theory	-one primitive microbe ingested another, forming a symbiosis
