What did Dimitri Ivanovski contribute to virology?	infectious tobacco mosaic virus isolated in filtered, bacteria-free fluid
What did Felix D'Herelle contribute to virology?	discovered bacteriophages (coined term plaque
What did Walter Reed contribute to virology?	Showed that yellow fever was a virus transmitted by mosquitoes
What is the size range for viruses?	10 and 100 nm
How long is typical virus genomes?	few thousand to 200,000 nucleotides long
What are the two most typical shapes of viral capsids?	helical or icosahedral
What are four components of a typical bateriophage?	-Genome --Capsid --Tail --Tail fibres
List 4 steps of typical viral replication process	-adhere >> uncoat >> synthesis >> assembly >> exit
What are the typical processes that virus empoly to enter animal cells? [3]	-endocytosis of non enveloped: attach to cell surface >> intiate endocytosis >> endosome surrounds virus inside >> the nucleocapsi ecapes to cytoplams and uncoats... --membrane fustion: virus attach to cell receptor >> receptor changes >> membrane fuse >>release.. --Membrance endocytosis: all the same until step 4 ,where the low pH of endosome initate membrane fusion
What plays an imporant role in plant virus infection? Why?	-External damage to the cell wall --it is a lot harder to penetrate cell walls for viruses
How does virus enter bacterial cells?	-Tail fibres attach to cell receptors --shaft comes down, inject the core through the cell membrane -the core releases genome
Temperate phage versus lytic phage?	temperate phage can be both lytic or exit. lytic phate are lytic...
lytic phage?	phage enter, replicate, and lyse host cell
temerate phage?	phage integrate their genome into host cell's genome and become a prophage. Replicate with the host cell until stress. Can enter lytic phase.
3 virus origin theory:	-coevolution hypothesis: viruses evolved with microbes --Regressiv e hypothesis: viruses used to be living organisms --progressive hypothesis: viruses originated from genetic material
Cultivating bacteriophage:	Mix phage and host bacteria and grow them on a petri dish. There will be spots of plaques on the "lawn" of bacteria
Cultivating Animal Viruses?	needs tissue culture of host cells and advance equipment
Viral Purification?	-filtration >> centrifugation mass spectrometry.
gradient centrifugation	-bacteria are separated based to their mass in a gradiented sucrose solution.
titer	concentration of a virus preparation
4 viral quantification methods?	-direct count --hemagglutination assay --plaque assay --endpoint assay
Direct count	-direcly count viruses using electron microscopes --expensive and doessn't differentiate between infectious and non-infectious viral particles
Hemagglutination	-exploits trait of some viruses to stick to red blood cells, causing them to form a gel mat --cheap, easy, fast but doesn't give much info --counting button wells (+) and shield wells (-)
plaque assay	-virus diluted and placed in target cells --count forming plaques
Endpoint assay	-tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) --lethan dose (LD50)
What are the two virus classification schemes?	-ICTV classification scheme --The baltimore classification system
ICTV Classificaiton Shceme 	-International committee on Taxonomy of Viruses --classify viruses based on Order, Family, Subfamily, Genus, and Species
The Baltimore Classification System	-based around mRNA production methods	-separates viruses into seven classes --developed by Nobel laureate David Baltimore
Viroids	-not a virus --consists only of naked RNA --extremely small --only infect plants
Prions	-not a virus, but rather a protein particle --mad cow disease
CRISPR	-clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats -a defense mechanism against virus --basically holds a record of virus attacks and destroys viruses upon detection
