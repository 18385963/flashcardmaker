Bacterial morphologies & habitat [5]	-spherical(coccus) --not very mobile\m-rod-shaped(bacillus) --can swim better\n-comma-shaped(vibrio) --swim even better??\n-spiral(spirillum) --internal flagella, screw their way through environment\n-pleiomophic(random shapes)
Advantage to being larger/smaller	-smaller allows better nutrient uptake efficiency
Bactrial Multicelluar organizations [3]	-hyphae(barnching filaments of cells)\n-mycelia(tufts of hyphae\n-trichomes(smooth,unbranched chains of cells)
Cytoplam of bacteria [11]	-nucleoid\n-histone like proteins\n-DNA,RNA synthesis\n-Regulatory factors(control replication, transcription and translation)\n-Ribosomes\n-Plasmids\n-Enzymes breaking down substrates\n-Inclusion bodies\n-Gas vesicles\n-Magnetosomes\n-Cytoskeletal structures
The largest area in bacterial plamid is?	nucleoid
How does bacteria structure DNA	-use of cations\n-use of positively charged proteins\n-topoisomerases enable DNA "supercoiling"
Functions of bacterial plama membrane?	nutrient transport, energy fcapture, sensory systems
MreB	provides structure to bacteria cells
ester linkages	chemical link that connects hydropillic polar head to hydrophobic fatty acid tails of a phospholipid in cell wall
Facilitated diffusion and co-transport	-move by concentration gradient\n-no energy required
Active transport	-protein transporter moves particles against concentration gradient\n-requries energy
Protein secretion	-shipping proteins outside the cell\n-uses ATP energy
Bacterial cell wall is made of	NAM and NAG and peptide crosslink
Transpeptidation	-connect NAM and NAM to form pentapiptide crosslink
Transglycosylation	-connect NAM and NAG together
How does lysozyme work?	cleaves the backbone of peptidoglycan
Gram-positive cells	-THICC outer layer of peptidoglycan\n-Negatively charged lipoteichoic acids in the peptidoglycan\n-Purple after the Gram-Stain
Gram-negaive Cells	-Thin outer layer\n-outer membrane contain lipopolysaccharide\n-Pink after Gram-Stain
Molecues get out of the Gram negative cell.. [3]	Through the falagellum acting as a syringe\n-through porin (diffusion)\n-TonB-dependent receptors catalyze high-affinity active transport of molecules
Pili	Allow attachment to places
Chemotaxis	Chemoreceptor proteins temporally sense changes in concentraions of attractants or repellents (how bacteria navigate)
Nonflagellar motitity include	-Gliding\n-Twitching\n-Polymerization of actin in host cells for propulsion
Capsules	Thick layer of polysaccharides surrounding some cells\n-provide adhesion and defense\n-help form biofilms
Surface Arrays(S-Layers)	-layer of interlocking proteins\n-offers protection\n-found in both Gram - and Gram + cells
Taxonomy structure	-Domain(Kingdom),phylum,class,order,family,genus,species
fimbriae	aid cells to adhere to surfaces
